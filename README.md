# SweetCrush


[Sweet Crush](https://dev.to/yaswanthteja/candycrush-game-using-html-css-javascript-11pp) is a web based game which is inspired from the candy crush saga, SweetCrush is built by HTML, CSS, and java script, where the core gameplay is based on swapping two adjacent candies among several on the gameboard as to make a row or column of at least three matching-colored candies.

We all know the simple candies that we can pop by combining at least three candies in a horizontal or vertical line. They are colorful candies that are the basic elements of the game which are used to make special candies if brought in a specific combination together. It includes:

- Red candy (sausage-shaped).
- Blue candy (spherical-shaped).
- Green candy (pillow/square shaped).
- Yellow candy (tear-drop shaped).
- Orange candy (pill-shaped).
- Purple candy (hexagon-shaped).
